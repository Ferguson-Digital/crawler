SAFE USE OF PROPS
The mymobility app contains instructional exercise videos (chosen and prescribed by your surgeon as part of your care plan) in which props are used are used to complete the exercises. If you have any questions or concerns about your use of props or the exercises in general, please discuss with your surgeon.

STURDY CHAIR
For support in many of your therapy exercises, a chair is referenced as a good prop. You can use any chair that is sturdy, does not recline or have wheels to provide you with adequate support to lean on while standing. The chair needs to have even leg lengths so it is not wobbly. Please only use the chair in areas that are non-slip and ensure the chair is at an appropriate and comfortable height so you can stand tall and upright while using it. For therapy exercises, please do not use the chair in any way that is not directly instructed. Do not stand on the chair or lean back on two legs; these actions could result in a fall.

TOWEL
You will need a towel for some of the exercises to either assist in stretching, or use for comfortable support. One towel should be long enough to wrap around a two-liter bottle. Another towel needs to be long enough so that you can hold on to it with both hands while hooking it around the bottom of your foot. A beach or bath towel would work best. For the purpose of therapy exercises, do not use the towel in any way you are not instructed, such as stepping on it, as you could fall.

EMPTY TWO-LITER BOTTLE
You will see an empty two-liter bottle used in some of the mymobility exercises. This is to provide support or proper positioning during exercises. You may use a full two-liter bottle if needed, but be careful because it can be heavy and may spill. If you do have an empty bottle to use, keep the top on to hold in the air and increase its stiffness. Do not attempt to stand or balance on the two-liter bottle. It is not intended to provide support for your head. Use the bottle only in ways that are instructed in the mymobility application.

RESISTANCE BAND
A resistance band is an elastic band that can be used to offer resistance during exercises instead of weights. You can buy these online or in sporting goods stores, or your physician or physical therapist may give some to you. Generally, different color bands are different resistances. You will need to learn the brand of your resistance band to learn its color scheme. Some resistance bands contain latex so if you have a latex allergy, be sure to look for or ask for latex-free bands.
Below are some tips on how to best use these tools.

Setting up your resistance band:
Tying a loop in the end of the resistance band makes it much easier to anchor to objects. The loop can either be directly looped around something (e.g. a door handle), or the knot from the loop can be shut into a door to stabilize that end of the band. Anchoring the band allows you to pull away from its anchor to perform exercises with resistance. If you prefer, you may also tie the ends of the band together in order to be able to hold the band in a loop. The loop can be looped around your ankle for leg exercises or held in your hand for arm exercises.

Picking the intensity of your resistance band:
If you find all repetitions of an exercise easy, the band does not have enough resistance. However, if you struggle through the whole exercise, the band has too much resistance. The last three to five repetitions should be difficult, but not impossible with the correct band. If an exercise is too easy for you and you don’t have a higher resistance band, try stepping further away from your anchor or starting the band in a more stretched position, as this will increase the resistance.

Using the band safely:
Never wrap your resistance band tightly around you as it can cut off blood circulation. Keep in mind, resistance bands should not be used as wraps, bandages, or ropes or as a means to stabilize anything into place. If you have an allergic reaction after using your band, such as redness, swelling, or itching, immediately stop using the band and contact whoever gave you the band. Either your physician or physical therapist should be able to help you find a different band, or the store you bought it from may offer assistance in finding a different brand type that may work better for you. Only use the resistance band as instructed.

THERAPY BALLS
Therapy balls of varying sizes may be needed for some of your exercises. For some exercises, you may be able to use a ball you have at home (such as a soccer ball or volleyball), but for other exercises, a large exercise ball may be required. Types and uses of different ball sizes are explained below:

Small balls:
Some exercises may ask you to squeeze a small ball between your knees. This small ball should have a diameter of 15-25 cm (six to nine inches); it should be no larger than an adult-sized soccer ball but big enough to hold your knees at least a few inches apart. You may use a soccer ball or volleyball if that’s all you have, but a soft, plastic, inflatable ball may work better, as it will squeeze easier and be more comfortable. You should be able to find a small plastic ball at a local sporting goods store, or online.

Medium and Large Balls:
You may know medium and large therapy balls as yoga balls or exercise balls. These are soft plastic inflatable balls 45-85 cm (17-33 inches) in diameter. You will need to find a ball size that best fits your needs. A ball that is medium-sized to you may be large to someone else, or vice versa. You may be asked to sit on this ball or use it behind your back for certain exercises.
If you are instructed to sit on the ball, make sure:

 1. You can put your feet flat on the floor and keep even weight in each of them.
 2. You can sit upright with your shoulder and hips in a vertical line. If you’re struggling to stay upright, a different ball size may be needed.
 3. You don’t violate any surgical precautions you have been instructed to follow while sitting on the ball.
 4. For safest use, your knees should be at or just below hip-level. Your thighs should either be parallel to or pointing slightly towards the ground, but never pointing towards the ceiling. If the ball is too low, you may have more trouble keeping your balance and fall, or struggle to get up or down.

You should be able to find these therapy balls at your local sporting goods store, or online. You may also be able to buy one at a discount from your physician or physical therapist.

SMALL STEP STOOL
A small step stool will be needed in some of the advanced exercises you may see in your therapy exercises. These are most often used with stepping exercises targeted at improving leg strength or endurance. This step stool should be six to eight inches high as this is the height of most stairs and curbs. If this is too hard for you to start, you may start with a lower step. It is important to remember the following guidelines regarding your step stool:

 1. Make sure to place the step stool on solid level, away from slippery surfaces.
 2. All four legs of the stool need to be on the ground so the stool is not wobbly.
 3. Check the integrity of the stool. Do not use if it is rusted or cracked and check that the stool is stable and will not break during use.
 4. If you struggle with balance, place the stool by a wall or counter. This will give you a sturdy object to hang on to and will provide additional support while you complete your exercises.
 5. If you’re having a hard time stepping up, your step may be too high—try a lower one until you improve your strength.

If you do not have a stool available, you may choose to use the bottom step of your stairs. If you choose this option, clear the step of objects, only use level steps, and use a wide enough to support your entire foot.

FLOOR/YOGA MAT
The floor will often be referenced in the exercise videos. If the floor is uncomfortable for you, place a yoga mat down for extra cushion. Remember to clear the area you will use of any objects that are not needed to complete your exercises before putting down the mat. You should have enough space around the mat to be able to reach with your arms and legs without hitting anything. When using the mat you should be in bare feet or wearing shoes with good support and non-slip soles, such as tennis shoes; socks can easily slip on mats and cause a fall. Do not wear flip-flops or other slip-on shoes on the yoga mat. Once you are finished with your exercises, make sure to put your yoga mat away, as it can pose a tripping hazard when not in use. You should be able to find yoga mats at sporting goods stores, or online.

WALKER
A walker is a form of an assistive device and is used to supply you with stability and support. You may use a walker to help you walk after surgery.

Before using the walker, you need to ensure that the fit is correct. To do this, stand next to the walker and relax your arms straight down. The handles of the walker should be approximately even with your wrists. If not, adjust accordingly using the push tabs on the bottom of the walker. The lengths of all the legs need to be the same so that the handles of the walker stay straight instead of sloping.

Here are some important things to remember when using a walker:

 1. Do not place your full weight onto the walker. It is only there for partial weight support.
 2. Always maintain at least one foot in contact with the floor when using your walker.
 3. Stay upright while using the walker. Do not allow yourself to slump or lean forward.
 4. Keep your walker close to your body. You do not want to reach far for the walker, as this will decrease its ability to provide you with support and increase your chance of falling.
 5. Ensure your walker is of high quality. Signs of rust or large dents decrease the structural support of the walker.
 6. If you have never used a walker before, you should consult your physician or physical therapist about how to use it before walking with it.

If you have any questions or concerns about your walker, please reach out to your care team!
