CLINICIAN USER GUIDE
GENERAL
 * Purpose of mymobility program:mymobility is a care management system designed to support you and your care team while monitoring passive and active patient interactions with their assigned protocol through the patient mobile application. The goal of the mymobility app is to keep patients engaged in the preparation and recovery process for their orthopedic procedure. Patients who qualify and are enrolled receive educational information, as well as exercises both pre- and post-operatively, encouraging them to take an active role in their recovery. The app also collects Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and allows for secure encrypted messaging that keeps the care team up to date with patient questions and progress. By supporting patients outside of the surgical event, you are able to reduce the variability of care and differentiate the care process.
 * About:To view details about the mymobility program, use the “About” link at the bottom of every page. From there, you can also view the Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement.
 * Support:For assistance with issues not covered by this user guide, please contact customer support at +1 (844) 799-8208, during the hours of 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. If you leave a message, we will return your call the following business day.

PATIENT DETAILS PAGE
ThePatient Detailspage includes a summary of information about the patient including the patient’s progress, protocol, messages, surveys, and an overall history of activity involving the patient. Within the Patient Details page, you will find there are multiple sections providing you with the following in-depth patient details:

 * Patient Details Page Layout:The patient summary provides a static section of basic patient information throughout thePatient Detailspage. The information available in this header summary bar includes the patient’s basic demographic information, most recent location and disposition, procedure, care team, assigned protocol and level, and a flag icon indicating attention is needed on a patient’s profile.
   
   
    * Patient Information:The patient’s basic demographic information (i.e., profile photo, name, age, gender), as well as the MRN are displayed within the summary bar.
    * Apple Watch Icon:If the patient uses or has used Apple Watch as part of the mymobility program, there will be a watch icon on the lower left corner of the patient’s profile photo.
      
    * Location:The patient’s location and utilization will display in the summary bar. This information displays a post-surgical patient’s location, reported by him/her in the mobile app. Before the surgery, the location will show as the location of the surgery (i.e., Hospital or Surgery Center), chosen by the clinical user when enrolling the patient. After the surgery, the location will show as the most recently reported. Next to the location in the summary bar, there is an ellipses icon that, when clicked, will take you to a separate page calledDisposition. This page includes two tables of information for self-reported patient location and physical therapy/home health sessions. The following is the information included in both the tables: 1. TheLocation Tabledisplays a patient’s post-surgery locations. It also includes the date a patient started in a location, the patient’s location, and the number of days a patient was at that location. The potential location options could be any of the following: 1. Hospital:When enrolling a patient, a clinical user can select if the patient will be having their surgery at a hospital or surgery center. This will appear as the patient’s location until the patient reports he/she is elsewhere.
           2. Surgery Center:When enrolling a patient, a clinical user can select if the patient will be having their surgery at a hospital or surgery center. This will appear as the patient’s location until the patient reports he/she is elsewhere.
           3. Skilled Nursing Facility:A healthcare facility where a patient stays overnight and continues to receive therapy in-house.
           4. Home:The patient has reported that he/she is recovering at home. When patients are at home, they can report their utilization which will appear in the Physical Therapy table on this page.

MESSAGES
This section will explain the messaging capabilities between patients and clinical users throughout mymobility. You can access the messaging thread from a few different places:Header→Messages Icon→Messages PageORHome Page→Patient Details Page→Messages TabORHome Page→Messages Page.

 * You can message patients, along with the patient’s other care team members in one messaging thread. Each patient will have only ONE ongoing message thread and any member of the patient’s care team can send/receive messages in the thread. Please follow the instructions below to send a patient a new message: * From the “message thread,” enter the message in the dialog box next to the “Send” button.
    * When you have finished composing your message, click the “Send” button.
    * Your message should now appear on the bottom of the thread, since it is the most recent message. The patient will receive a notification when they receive a new message.
    * Underneath each message in the thread, there is a line that says who sent the message, the date the message was sent, and the time it was sent. Next to each message, a user’s profile photo will display.
    * Note:If you do not have a profile photo in the system, the patient will see a placeholder photo instead.
    * In the right column (next to the message thread) is the patient’s contact information, along with a list of names of the clinical users who are in their care team.
   
   
   
   
 * Messages Icon:Clicking the messages icon from the Header will you take to theMessagespage where you can see the message threads for all of your patients. The “Messages” icon in the main mymobility header bar will have a magenta-colored superscript number in the upper right corner if there are any unresolved message threads.
   
 * Messages Page Layout:TheMessagespage includes a variety of information about the type of message sent and ways to sort your messages.Keep in mindthe following items for easier navigation on this page:
   
   
    * Within theMessagespage, there is a header bar with different sorting options as well as several columns of message information. 1. In theMessagespage header bar, you can see the following items: 1. Number of unresolved messages you have.
           2. Most recent drop-down menu→Click here to sort your messages in the following ways: 1. Most recent:Sort the messages so the most recent messages are at the top and the oldest messages at the bottom.
               2. Unresolved:Sort so that patients with unresolved messages appear at the top.
               3. Last name:Sort messages alphabetically (in descending order, A-Z) by the patient’s last name.
              
              
          
          
       2. Within the messaging columns, you can see the following information: 1. Profile Photo and Patient Name:The patient’s profile photo will show first, with his/her name.
           2. Most recent text:This column will show up to two lines of the message text, depending on the text. If there is additional information beyond those two lines, there will be an ellipsis (…) to indicate more text. If there is a photo or video in the most recent message, there will be an icon depicting that type of message in the content line of the message.
           3. Date/Time:If the most recent message was sent today, this column will show the time the message was sent. If the message was sent yesterday, it will read “Yesterday.” If it was sent within the last week, (but not today or yesterday) it will show the day of the week. If the message was sent longer than a week ago, it will display the date in MM/DD/YY format.
           4. Resolved/Unresolved:If a message hasnot been resolvedyet, an exclamation point will appear on the far-right side of the message line. If a message hasbeen resolved, there will be no exclamation point.
          
          
      
      
    * Anunresolved messageis a message that hasnot yetbeen taken care of and therefore needs action by a care team member. When a message is unresolved, all care team members will see the unresolved icon.
    * Any care team member can mark a patient’s message asresolved.Keep in mindthat marking a message as resolved will dismiss all notifications fromother care team members’ dashboards and messaging screens.
    * By default, the messages list will show the most recent messages received at the top of the list and the older messages at the bottom.Note:If you have no messages yet, the screen will say: “No messages have been received.”
    * Clicking on a message line will take you directly to the message thread on thePatient Detailspage.
    * When a patient is discharged from the mymobility program, their message string will be removed from your message list.
