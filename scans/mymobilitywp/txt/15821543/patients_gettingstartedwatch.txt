The first, a welcome email, details the next steps you will need to take to register your account as well as instructions for ordering your Apple Watch. You will also receive an email with your temporary password that you will use to log in to the app for the first time.

DEVICE AND ACCOUNT SETUP – IPHONE

During the first few log ins of mymobility, you will be asked if you’d like to allow the app to send you notifications. Select OK to receive important reminders of items that require your attention within the app, such as messages from your care team or to do list items.

ACTIVATE ACCOUNT
When you launch the app, you will see the main log in screen. If this is your first time using the app you will need to selectActivate Account. On the next screen, enter your email address and the temporary password provided in the welcome emails.

AGREE TO PRIVACY POLICY AND EULA
During the account setup process, you will be presented with both a Privacy Policy and EULA (End-user license agreement). Read and agree to both documents by following the on-screen prompts.

LOGIN USING NEW USERNAME AND PASSWORD
After you’ve successfully created your account with your new username and password, you will login in to mymobility using these new credentials.

DEVICE AND ACCOUNT SETUP – APPLE WATCH
INITIAL STEPS
If you haven’t already updated your iOS software on your iPhone prior to now, do so now. This is required for proper use with the Apple Watch. Instructions for updating your phone’s software are available in the “Device Setup – iPhone: Update iOS software” section of this guide.

Additionally, you will need to make sure the mymobility app is installed on your iPhone. This process should have also installed the mymobility app on your Apple Watch. If this isn’t the case, go to the Watch app on your iPhone, navigate to the “My Watch” tab, scroll down to available apps, and tap the Install button next to mymobility.

UNBOX AND CHARGE YOUR WATCH
When you receive your Apple Watch you will need to make sure the device is fully charged. Turn the device on and place on the included charger. While the device is charging, a green “lightning bolt” should appear on the screen.

PAIR WATCH TO IPHONE
In order for the Apple Watch to communicate with your iPhone, the two must be “paired”. Make sure Bluetooth is active on your iPhone by going into the Settings app, selecting Bluetooth and confirming that the switch is toggled to “On”.

Make sure your Apple Watch and iPhone are both turned on, put the Watch on your wrist and hold it close to the iPhone. The pairing process should begin automatically. If it does not, choose the “Watch” icon from your iPhone screen.

Follow the on-screen prompts to continue this process. You will be asked to use the iPhone’s camera to point at the Watch. If for some reason you are not able to use the camera on your phone, you may select Pair Apple Watch Manually.

Continue to follow the pairing steps on your iPhone. You will be asked to sign-in with your Apple ID. You will want to use the same Apple ID account that is signed in on your iPhone.

Near the end of the pairing process, you will be asked to choose features and apps to install on your Apple Watch. At this point in the process, you should already have the mymobility app on your iPhone. If so, choose Install All, and the companion app will install on your Watch.

WATCHOS SOFTWARE UPDATE
You may need to update the software version of your Apple Watch. We require watchOS version 4 and above. To check and/or update, open the “Watch” app on your iPhone, select the “General” button to enter the basic Watch settings screen, and select “Software Update”. This will check for a new version of the watchOS software and allow you to download and update, if necessary.

ALLOW NOTIFICATIONS FROM WATCH
During the first launch of the mymobility watch app you will be asked to allow notifications to be sent to your watch. Choose “Allow” to receive notifications when you have tasks to complete or when you have new messages from your care team.

GRANT HEALTHKIT PERMISSIONS FROM WATCH
While setting up the watch app, you will be asked to allow mymobility access to your health data. Choose the OK button during these prompts in order to allow syncing of your health data from the Apple Watch to your iPhone and the mymobility app.

RELAUNCH IPHONE APP
After accepting the required permissions on the Apple Watch app, you will need to restart the iPhone app in order to complete the process. This is necessary to bring the two apps in sync.

USAGE – IPHONE
LOG IN USING NEW USER NAME AND PASSWORD
After you’ve successfully created your account, you will log in to the iPhone app using your new username and password for all future usage of the app. When you launch the app, select Log In and proceed to next screen where you will input your credentials.

OPT IN OR OUT OF TOUCH ID OR FACE ID
One of the first few times you log in using your chosen username and password, you will be asked to allow the use of Touch ID or Face ID for future log ins. This will vary based on your iPhone hardware.

USAGE – APPLE WATCH
OPEN MYMOBILITY WATCH APP TO SYNC STATISTICS AND ASSIGNED TASKS
You will need to open the mymobility Apple Watch app after you’ve paired your devices, installed the apps, and have logged in for the first time. This process will sync your health statistics and tasks assigned to you. From the apps screen on your Apple Watch look for the mymobility logo and tap on it.
